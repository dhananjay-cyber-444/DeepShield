🛡️ DeepShield – Deepfake vs Real Image Detection
DeepShield is a deep learning–powered image classification model designed to detect deepfake images vs real images with high accuracy. Built on top of Hugging Face Transformers and Vision Transformers (ViT), the project leverages transfer learning to fine-tune a pretrained model (dima806/deepfake_vs_real_image_detection) on a custom dataset.

🌍 Project Motivation
The rise of deepfake technology has brought both innovation and threats. While AI-generated media can create impressive visuals, it also poses serious risks, including:

📰 Misinformation & Fake News – spreading false narratives using manipulated images.

🎭 Identity Fraud – using deepfakes for impersonation or scams.

🔒 Digital Security Threats – undermining trust in online communication.

DeepShield is built to counter these threats by providing a reliable tool for automatic detection of manipulated images, ensuring trust and authenticity in the digital world.

📂 Dataset Structure
Your dataset should follow the structure:

dataset/
│── Dataset/
    ├── Train/
    │    ├── Real/
    │    └── Fake/
    ├── Validation/
         ├── Real/
         └── Fake/
Real/ → Contains authentic images.

Fake/ → Contains deepfake/manipulated images.
